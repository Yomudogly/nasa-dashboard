# **Product Requirements Document (PRD): NASA Dashboard**

## **1. Overview**

* **App Name:** NASA Dashboard  
* **Description:** A visually immersive, web-based dashboard that displays a list of the closest near-Earth objects (NEOs) for any given date. The application is designed for experienced developers, featuring a high-quality codebase, a modern technology stack, and a slick, futuristic user interface.  
* **Tagline:** Explore the cosmos, one asteroid at a time.

## **2. Target Audience**

* **Primary Users:** Experienced software developers.  
* **Demographics:** Technologically savvy individuals who appreciate clean code, modern architecture, best development practices, and a high-quality, aesthetically pleasing user interface.  
* **Goals:** To use a well-built and visually engaging application for viewing NASA's near-Earth object data. They value performance, design, and a seamless user experience.

## **3. Key Features & Prioritization**

### **P0: Must-Have Features (MVP)**

* **NEO Data Display:** Fetch and display a list of near-Earth objects from the NASA NeoWs API for a user-selected date.  
* **Data Points:** For each object, display its Name, Size (estimated diameter), Closeness to Earth (miss distance), and Relative Velocity.  
* **Date Picker:** Allow users to select a specific date to fetch NEO data. The app should default to the current date on initial load.  
* **Sorting:** Allow users to sort the list of objects by Size, Closeness to Earth, and Relative Velocity.  
* **Interactive Visualization:** Display objects visually in a "deep space" scene. Hovering over an item in the list highlights the corresponding object in the visualization, and vice-versa. Clicking/tapping an object displays a pop-up with its details.  
* **Responsive Design:** The application must be fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

### **P1: Future Improvements**

* **Detailed Object View:** A dedicated page or expanded modal showing more comprehensive data for a selected NEO.  
* **Date Range Selection:** Allow users to select a date range (e.g., a full week) to view objects.  
* **User Accounts:** Ability for users to save searches or favorite objects.  
* **Push Notifications:** Alert users about particularly close or large objects.

## **4. UI/UX Vision**

* **Theme:** Dark, deep space theme with a clean, futuristic, and awe-inspiring aesthetic.  
* **Layout:** A "glassmorphism" UI panel on the left for controls and data, with the main viewport dedicated to a dynamic, interactive visualization of space, featuring a parallax starfield and a view of Earth.  
* **Interactivity:** Smooth animations, clear hover/active states, and seamless interaction between the data panel and the space visualization.

## **5. Success Metrics**

* **User Engagement:** High-quality feedback from the developer community (e.g., on social media, forums).  
* **Performance:** Fast initial page load (<2s) and snappy UI interactions.  
* **Code Quality:** The project serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating best practices in modern web development.

## **6. Assumptions & Risks**

* **Assumption:** The NASA NeoWs API will be available and reliable.  
* **Assumption:** The DEMO_KEY will be sufficient for development and testing, but a dedicated API key will be needed for production.  
* **Risk:** The visual complexity of the UI could pose performance challenges on lower-end devices if not carefully optimized.  
* **Risk:** The NASA API data structure may change, requiring updates to the backend data transformation logic.
