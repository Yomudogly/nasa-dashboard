## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query
- **Backend:** Fastify, TypeScript, Redis
- **Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- **DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose

### Installation & Setup

1.**Clone the repository:**

  ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Yomudogly/nasa-dashboard.git](https://github.com/Yomudogly/nasa-dashboard.git)
    cd nasa-dashboard
  ```

2.**Environment Variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. You can use the `DEMO_KEY` for development, but it is heavily rate-limited.
  
  ```md
    # backend/.env
    NASA_API_KEY=DEMO_KEY
  ```

3.**Build and run the containers:**

This single command will build the Docker images and start the frontend, backend, and Redis services.

  ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
  ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
